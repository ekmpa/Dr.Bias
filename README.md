This research project focuses on the newfound usage of LLMs as medical assistance chatbots. Considering their increased use, we look to decipher the dangers of this new paradigm, specifically by analysing the difference in responses that such models will give to different 'patient' profiles. By analyzing tone, detail and depth disparities between distinct socio-demographic groups, we hope to bring attention to the lacunes of existing models.
